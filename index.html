			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>What I have done in my proposal, the interface style seems to be my first point that I want to achieve. I mainly focus on the visual effect but neglect to make the interface convenient for the users to understand the information of the charity in detail.</p>
		 <center><img src="mock up1.jpg" alt="mock up1" width=500/></center>
			<p>Although the interface looks quite interesting and fits the theme of the charity, the function part still needs to be improved. So the composition of the website should be more concise for the users to find what they want to see. </p>
      <p>And the "projects" section needs to be reconsidered, the interface of this section is a bit inconvenient for the users to look for the projects that they are interested in. </p>

			<h2>Development</h2>
			<p>I first developed a nav for the website. This has become really common to see the navigation bar appear on a website. But I cannot ignore the funtion of the nav, it is really helpful for the users to reach the page that they want immediately. And I also did a hover effect for the buttons on the nav bar. </p>
		<center><img src="1.jpg" alt="1" width=700/></center>
    <center><img src="2.jpg" alt="2" width=700/></center>
			<p>I added a several new sections on the home page to increase the amount of the information of the charity, such as more pictures and details of the charity events. </p>
			<center><img src="3.jpg" alt="3" width=700/></center>
      <center><img src="4.jpg" alt="4" width=700/></center>
			<p>The "contact us" section can let the users have the chance to know more about the charity and the Indian children's situation.</p>
      <p>Now the whole interface of the website is much cleaner and simpler. All the sections become easier for the users to identify.</p>
      <center><img src="5.jpg" alt="5" width=700/></center>
      <p>For the "projects" section, I combined the past projects and the present projects together and rearrange them like shown in the screenshot. This composition can list all the projects in one screen so there is no need for the users to scroll down the page. </p>
      <center><img src="6.jpg" alt="6" width=700/></center>
      <p>I didn't do much changes to the "about" section. The composition stays the same, but I changed the background color of the section to make a stronger contrast between the background color and the font color. That will improve the users' visual experience when they browsing the page.</p>
      <center><img src="7.jpg" alt="7" width=700/></center>
      I did the last part of the donation section in the porposal. This page is for the users to fill in their payment details and take action to support the Indian children.
